## KW 41 (09.10 - 15.10)
### P + L
- Finding Ideas
    - Path-Finder AR-App
    - epidemic safe public scedual display
    - intelligent room lighting
    - visualising of neural networks and manipulate the weights
## KW 42 (16.10 - 22.10)
### P + L
- Working on ideas for visualising NN
    - Unity
    - ThreeJS
    - researching for Ideas on other Examples on the Internet
### P
- started researching about creating NN from scratch with JS
### L
- started with first persona
## KW 43 (23.10 - 29.10)
### P
- Starting JS-ThreeJS Project for visualisation
### L
- created some Personas
- created one szenario
## KW 44 (30.10 - 05.11)
### P
- visual connections between neurons
### L
- Creating Figma Clickabel UI Design for whole Application
## KW 45 (06.11 - 12.11)
### L
- Creating fnteraction functionalitys in small local Project
## KW 46 (13.11 - 19.11)
### P + L
- Creating Ideas about scientific interaction purpose of project
    - not: visualisation and interaction with visualisation itselt --> no reason why this should be scientific
    - more like: specific interaction with visualisation:
        - is using the mousewheel and directly clicking on the weights more intuitive than using sliders on the side?
- Tested TensorflowJS to use NN-Logic
### L
- Including interaction functionalitys in shared Project
- Bug fixing raycaster for interaction
- Including layers so that the raycaster ignores the connections
- created protocol and created protocols for weeks aferwards
- added CameraController (fixed logic from P)
