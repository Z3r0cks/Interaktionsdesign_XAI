- Creating Ideas about scientific interaction purpose of project
    - not: visualisation and interaction with visualisation itselt --> no reason why this should be scientific
    - more like: specific interaction with visualisation:
        - is using the mousewheel and directly clicking on the weights more intuitive than using sliders on the side?
### L
- Including interaction functionalitys in shared Project
- Bug fixing raycaster for interaction
- Including layers so that the raycaster ignores the connections
- created protocol and created protocols for weeks aferwards
